# Queues

## General Notes

- (FIFO) First in, First our rule
    - Think grocery store
- Since Queue is also an ADT, we can essentially use Deque methods within out Queue

```java
class Queue {
    private:
        Deque deque;
    public:
        bool enqueue(Data element);
        Data peek();
        void dequeue();
        int size();
};

// We could extremely trivially implement the Queue functions as follows:
bool Queue::enqueue(Data element) {
    return deque.addBack(element);
}
Data Queue::peek() {
    return deque.peekFront();
}
void Queue::dequeue() {
    deque.removeFront();
}
int Queue::size() {
    return deque.size();
}
```

- O(1) worst case scenario when enqueuing for a Linked List
- O(n) worst case scenario when enqueuing for a Circular array

## Basic Methods

- enqueue(element): Add element to the back of the Queue
- peek(): Look at the element at the front of the Queue
- dequeue(): Remove the element at the front of the Queue
