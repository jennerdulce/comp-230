# Linked Lists

## General Notes

- Useful if we do not know how many elements we want to store
- A Dynamically allocated data strucutre that grows dynamically in memory on its own very time efficient
    - Needed to explicitly reallocate memory as the backing array fills (time costly operation)
- Both linked lists and arrays can do the same thing but each have their respective pros and cons
- Consists of head and tail pointer

### Singly vs Doubly Linked Lists

- Singly: Each node only has a pointer, pointing to the node directly after it
- Doubly: Has a pointer to the node before and after it

##  Basic Methods

```java
find(element): // returns True if element exists in Linked List, otherwise returns False
    current = head                 // start at the "head" node
    while current is not NULL:
        if current.data == element:
            return True
        current = current.next     // follow the forward pointer of current
    return False                   // we iterated over all nodes but did not find "element"

find(index): // returns element at position "index" of Linked List (or NULL if invalid)
    if index < 0 or index >= n: // check for invalid indices
        return NULL             // we will use NULL to denote an invalid node

    curr = head                 // looking for an element in the middle of the Linked List
    repeat index times:         // move forward index times
        curr = curr.next
    return curr

insert(newnode, index): // inserts newnode at position "index" of Linked List
    if index == 0:                 // special case for insertion at beginning of list
        newnode.next = head
        head.prev = newnode
        head = newnode

    else if index == size:         // special case for insertion at end of list
        newnode.prev = tail
        tail.next = newnode
        tail = newnode

    else:                          // general case for insertion in middle of list
        curr = head
        repeat index-1 times:      // move curr to directly before insertion site
            curr = curr.next
        newnode.next = curr.next   // update the pointers
        newnode.prev = curr
        curr.next = newnode
        newnode.next.prev = newnode

    size = size + 1                // increment size

remove(index): // removes the element at position "index" of Linked List
    if index == 0:                 // special case for removing from beginning of list
        head = head.next
        head.prev = NULL

    else if index == n-1:          // special case for removing from end of list
        tail = tail.prev
        tail.next = NULL

    else:                          // general case for removing from middle of list
        curr = head
        repeat index-1 times:      // move curr to directly before removal site
            curr = curr.next
        curr.next = curr.next.next // update the pointers
        curr.next.prev = curr

    n = n - 1                      // decrement n

```

## Summary

- In summation, Linked Lists are great (constant-time) when we add or remove elements from the beginning or the end of the list, but finding elements in a Linked List (even one in which elements are sorted) cannot be optimized like it can in an Array List, so we are stuck with O(n) "find" operations. Also, recall that, with Array Lists, we needed to allocate extra space to avoid having to recreate the backing array repeatedly, but because of the dynamic allocation of memory for new nodes in a Linked List, we have no wasted memory here.
- Array-based and Linked data structures are two basic starting points for many more complicated data structures. Because one strategy does not entirely dominate the other (i.e., they both have their pros and cons), you must analyze each situation to see which approach would be better.
