## General Notes

- Abstract Data Types (ADT)
- Can approach Deque in 2 ways:
    - Linekd List (Doubly Linked List)
        - O(1) would be guaranteed for all seix of Deque operation
        - O(n) if a "find" method was implemented
        - Better option if we do not care about elements in the middle of the Queue
     - Circular Array
        - O(n) if backing array is full and have to create another array and compy the contents over
        - O(1) when finding an element in the middle of an array
